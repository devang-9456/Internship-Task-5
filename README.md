# Internship-Task-5
Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective

Capture live network packets, identify basic protocols, and analyze traffic generated by browsing YouTube.

## Steps Performed

1. **Installed Wireshark**
   - Downloaded and installed Wireshark.

2. **Started Packet Capture**
   - Selected active network interface and began capture.

3. **Generated Traffic**
   - Browsed https://www.youtube.com and played a video for 1 minute.

4. **Stopped Capture**

5. **Filtered Protocols**
   - TLS/SSL: Secure HTTPS traffic.
   - DNS: Domain lookups for YouTube and associated services.
   - TCP: Underlying transport for all major communication.

6. **Identified 3+ Protocols**
   - DNS, TLS/SSL, TCP.

7. **Exported .pcap File**
   - Saved as `Trace 5.pcap`.

8. **Summary & Analysis**
   - Observed encrypted HTTPS traffic with TLS handshake details.
   - DNS packets resolved YouTube and Google video domains.
   - TCP packets transport data between the browser and the servers.

## Files Included

- `task5_capture.pcap`: The Wireshark capture file.
- Screenshots showing filtered protocol packets.
- `README.md`: This explanation of methods and findings.

## Key Concepts

- Packet capture & export
- Protocol analysis (TLS/SSL, DNS, TCP, QUIC)
- Encrypted vs. unencrypted traffic
- Streaming media packet flow
- Filtering in Wireshark

---

*This task demonstrates advanced use of Wireshark and a clear understanding of protocols involved in encrypted web and media streaming.*
